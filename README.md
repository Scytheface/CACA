# CodeQL Algorithmic Complexity Analysis
Unfortunately, I must start this with an apology. This is because, as of yet, there is nothing else. I've started the work, but a constant stream of deadlines has forced delays. Nevertheless - there is hope. I've reserved the following few days for this project. If that is not sufficient and this counts as missing a critical deadline, then I accept my fate.
